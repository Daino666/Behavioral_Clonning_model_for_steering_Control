# Behavioral_Clonning_model_for_steering_Control

## Behavioral Cloning Project

This repository contains an implementation of a behavioral cloning model for autonomous driving based on the NVIDIA End-to-End Learning for Self-Driving Cars research paper. The model is trained to predict steering angles from camera images using deep learning.

## Project Description

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn steering commands from images taken from a front-facing camera on a virtual car.
The architecture is inspired by NVIDIA's paper:

End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars ‚Äî M. Bojarski et al., NVIDIA, 2016.

## Training the Model

### Prepare your dataset

  Collect driving data using the simulator in training mode.

  The dataset should be stored in the photos/ directory (or update the notebook path accordingly).

### Open the training notebook

  jupyter notebook Behavioral_cloning_project.ipynb


### Run the cells in the notebook to:

  Load and preprocess the data

  Train the CNN model based on NVIDIA's architecture (with small modifications)

### Save the trained model to the models/ folder

  Test your newly trained model in the simulator by running:
```
    python models/drive.py models/<your_model>.h5
```
